# Binary

*Binary digit* - implying a single number / digit **zero or one** ( *or can be call **Bit*** )

Human use the *Base-1 System* to count

Computer use a *Base-2* to count, which use **bits * 1** ( *Powered of 2 for every digits starting from 1* )
Example : 
![[Pasted image 20250401221639.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250401221656.png]]
	The value of this is *7* 

Computer needs more *bits* in order to count higher
Example : With *3 bits* the highest it can count is *7*
		Most computer nowadays use *64-bit system* for a single unit of data

*Byte* - consist of *8-bit* ( up to the *value of 256* )


# ASCII

*ASCII* - Short for *American Standard Code for Information Interchange* use a combination of set binary value to translate said value to letters (8-bit). 
Example :

*01000001* has the value of *65* and is translated to the letter A (Uppercase)

There is a library called *ASCII Mapping Chart* which shows all 256 possible mapping from all the of the possible value can be create through the system (8-bit) (For English at the very least)

# UNICODE

*UNICODE* - A system (*Currently 32-bits*) with aim to represent more than just the English Language, but *every languages in the world not limited to the present but also store ones from the past, and prepare ones in the future*.  
Moreover, it has also been used for more than just languages and numbers, *icons* have been added to the *Unicode Standard* 

The 32-bit system allows up to more than *4 Billions value*


# Representation

// Color
*RED GREEN BLUE (RGB)* - is a combination of 3 different values representing for 3 shade of *Red, Green and Blue* to create a *color*
Example : 
If the 3 values of RGB is **72 73 33**

Then the color created from the combination above would be a light yellow

// Image
*Image* is made of many pixels 

// Video
*Video* is made of many images, like a flip note animation


# Algorithms

*Algorithms* is basically step by step of instructions to solve a problem

Problem : Find a data in a big data structure
*n*: going to check each files one by one till find the corrected one
*n/2*: same as *n* but going two by one
*log2n*: halving the structure
